# Dependency Injection in .NET Core 2.0
This is the code repository for [Dependency Injection in .NET Core 2.0](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/dependency-injection-net-core-20?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787121300), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
.NET Core provides more control than ever over web application architectures. In this view of software architecture, one key point is that it's based on the use of Dependency Injection, as a way to properly implement the Dependency Inversion principle proposed in the SOLID principles established by Robert C. Martin.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

All code files are present in their respective chapter folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
      public Student(int id, string name, DateTime dob)
      {
          Id = id;
          Name = name;
          Dob = dob;
      }
```

You will need Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition, the Chrome Navigator, and IIS (Internet Information Server Express) to successfully test and execute all code files.
